Android crossword solver

![Crossword](https://github.com/billthefarmer/billthefarmer.github.io/raw/master/images/Crossword.png)

* 58,000 word dictionary
* Up to 22 letters

Set the number of letters in the word you are looking for using the
dropdown. If the number of slots won't fit on the screen, rotate the
phone so they will. The longest word in the dictionary is
counterrevolutionaries, which is 22 letters. Even if 22 slots won't
fit on the screen, the app should still find this word.

Fill in the letters you have in the slots. As each letter is entered
the next slot will be selected and the app will search for words. You
can also use the the keyboard **Next** button or the **Search** button
to search.

A list of matching words will appear below. If you touch a word in the
list, the slots will be filled in with that word, and a web search
will be made for the definition on
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).

There are two icons in the toolbar, **Help**, which will show the help
screen, and **About**, which will show the copyright, licence and
version.
