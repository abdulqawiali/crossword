* Words up to 22 letters
* 58,000 word dictionary
* Web search word definitions

Set the number of letters in the word you are looking for using the
dropdown. If the number of slots won't fit on the screen, rotate the
phone so they will. The letter slots will scroll sideways. The longest
word in the dictionary is counterrevolutionaries, which is 22 letters.
Even if 22 slots won't fit on the screen, the app should still find
this word.

Fill in the letters you have in the slots. As each letter is entered
the next slot will be selected and the app will search for words. You
can also use the the keyboard **Next** button or the **Search** button
to search. A stop character may be used as a wildcard.

A list of matching words will appear below. If you select a word in the
list, the slots will be filled in with that word, and a web search
will be made for the definition on
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).

There are two icons in the toolbar, **Help**, which will show the help
screen, and **About**, which will show the copyright, licence and
version.
