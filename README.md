Set the number of letters in the word you are looking for using the
dropdown. If the number of slots won't fit on the screen, rotate the
phone so they will.

Fill in the letters you have in the slots. Use the keyboard **Next**
button or the **Search** button to search.

A list of matching words will appear below. If you use the keyboard
**Next** button, a search will be done each time you enter a new
letter. If you touch a word in the list, the slots will be filled in
with that word.

There are two icons in the toolbar, **Help**, which will show the help
screen, and **About**, which will show the copyright, licence and
version.
