  Set the number of letters in the word you are looking for using the
  dropdown. If the slots won't fit on the screen, rotate the phone so
  they will. The longest word in the dictionary is
  counterrevolutionaries, which is 22 letters. Even if 22 slots won't
  fit on the screen, the app should still find this word.
</p>
<p>
  Fill in the letters you have in the slots. As each letter is entered
  the next slot will be selected and the app will search for
  words. You can also use the keyboard <b>Next</b> button or
  the <b>Search</b> button to search. A stop character may
  be used as a wildcard.
</p>
<p>
  A list of matching words will appear below. If you select a word in
  the list, the slots will be filled in with that word, and a new
  screen will show a web search for the definition of the word
  on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.
</p>
<p>
  There are two icons in the toolbar, <b>Help</b>, which will show the
  help screen, and <b>About</b>, which will show the copyright,
  licence and version.
