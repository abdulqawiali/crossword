<h3>Solve crossword entries</h3>
<p>
  Set the number of letters in the word you are looking for using the
  dropdown. If the slots won't fit on the screen, rotate the phone so
  they will. The letter slots will scroll sideways. The longest word
  in the dictionary is antidisestablishmentarianism, which is 28
  letters.  Even if 28 slots won't fit on the screen, the app should
  still find this word.
</p>
<p>
  Fill in the letters you have in the slots. As each letter is entered
  the next slot will be selected and the app will search for
  words. You can also use the keyboard <b>Next</b> button or
  the <b>Search</b> button to search. A stop character may
  be used as a wildcard.
</p>
<p>
  A list of matching words will appear below. If you select a word in
  the list, the slots will be filled in with that word, and a new
  screen will show a web search for the definition of the word
  on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.
</p>
<p>
  There are three icons in the toolbar, <b>Anagram</b>, which will
  show the anagram screen, <b>Help</b>, which will show the help
  screen, and <b>About</b>, which will show the copyright, licence and
  version.
</p>
<h3>Solve anagrams</h3>
<p>
  Type in the word or phrase you want anagrams for, and use the
  keyboard <b>Done</b> button or the <b>Search</b> button to
  search. The search may take a long time, depending on the length of
  the phrase. During the search the <b>Search</b> button is
  disabled. The anagram search uses a smaller 58,000 word dictionary
  to reduce the search time, and because the larger dictionary
  contains a large number of not very useful three and four letter
  words and scronyms.
