  Set the number of letters in the word you are looking for using the
  dropdown. If the slots won't fit on the screen, rotate the phone so
  they will. The longest word in the dictionary is
  counterrevolutionaries, which is 22 letters. Even if 22 slots won't
  fit on the screen, the app should still find this word.
</p>
<p>
  Fill in the letters you have in the slots. As each letter is entered
  the next slot will be selected and the app will search for
  words. You can also use the keyboard <b>Next</b> button or
  the <b>Search</b> button to search.
</p>
<p>
  A list of matching words will appear below. If you use the
  keyboard <b>Next</b> button, a search will be done each time you
  enter a new letter. If you select a word in the list, the slots will
  be filled in with that word, and a new screen will show a web search
  for the definition of the word
  on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.

<p>
  There are two icons in the toolbar, <b>Help</b>, which will show the
  help screen, and <b>About</b>, which will show the copyright,
  licence and version.
